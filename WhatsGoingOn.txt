1) Sticky footer?
2) D3JS
3) Modal overlay/content? Adjust size?
4) ForceUpdate??? If I take it out, refreshing logs out?
    warning.js:45 Warning: forceUpdate(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component.
    This usually means you called forceUpdate() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op.
    Please check the code for the App component.
