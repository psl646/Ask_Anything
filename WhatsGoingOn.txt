TODO TMRW:
1) Fix the send password glitch...?
2) Delete Questions from Question form
3) Grab data to send up to DB for Creation
4) Delete/Update/ETC with questions
5) Responses
6) Style




IDEAS -
1) set up the form on the render.
Have a counter and for that many times, add it to the board - seems clunky.
2) make a form store and constantly ping the server when there is an update... expensive


TRIED:
<form id="">
modifying the object somehow to have the information


Look up
D3JS
